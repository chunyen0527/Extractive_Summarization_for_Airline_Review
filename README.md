# Extractive_Summarization_for_Airline_Review

This project uses zero-shot classification, rule-based logic, and sentiment scoring to extract meaningful summaries from real-world airline reviews. The goal is to identify key topics, classify emotional tone, and highlight the most expressive sentence for each review.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle â€“ Airline Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chaudharyanshul/airline-reviews)  
- The dataset contains over 3700 airline passenger reviews from multiple carriers
- Each review is stored in the `ReviewBody` column

---

## Core Techniques

| Task | Method |
|------|--------|
| **Topic Labeling** | Zero-shot classification using `facebook/bart-large-mnli` |
| **Fallback Logic** | Regex-based keyword rules for low-confidence predictions |
| **Sentence Splitting** | `spaCy` with `sentencizer` for accurate segmentation |
| **Sentiment Analysis** | `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment` |
| **Summary Selection** | Chooses sentence with strongest polarity for each labeled topic |

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.12
- Hugging Face Transformers
- spaCy
- pandas / NumPy / regex
- PyTorch (via Transformers)

---

## Features Highlights

- Assigns **thematic labels** to each sentence (e.g., "Baggage", "Customer Service Response")
- Identifies **dominant sentiment** (positive / neutral / negative)
- Extracts the **most emotional sentence** related to each key topic
- Uses a **fallback rule system** to ensure robustness on low-confidence predictions
